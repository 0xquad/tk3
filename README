tk3 is open source software designed for the ICOM IC-R3
receiver.

I implemented tk3 in the Tcl/Tk scripting language which
enables it to run on a variety of operating systems,
including Linux and Microsoft Windows 98.
I have not tested tk3 on other platforms,
but it will probably work on them after little or no modification.

The free Tcl/Tk interpreter software must be installed
on your computer prior to using tk3.

Installation instructions may be found on the web at
http://parnass.org



                          Notes


The Linux version of tk3 presumes the wish windowing shell
is in your PATH.

USAGE NOTES

Obtain the proper TTL-to-RS232 adaptor for mating the
computer to the receiver.  Do not use a direct connect
cable.  I use the adaptor sold by RT Systems (http://rtsars.com).

In general, it's a good idea to connect the computer and radio
while the power to both is off.  It's inconvenient to turn the PC
off and on just to disconnect the radio so I use a serial port
switch box which connects my PC's serial port to one of four
devices and merely switch the radio in and out of the line.

After downloading and installing the software on your computer,
you must reboot your PC.

When you first start the program, you will asked to identify
which serial port is connected to the radio. (If you ever
relocate the radio to a different serial port,
you should remove the tk3.ini file and restart tk3.
tk3 will recreate the tk3.ini file for you.
Linux and MacOS X use an initialization
file named .tk3rc instead of tk3.ini.)

Once you've identified the proper serial port,
tk3 will open a couple of windows and display what
looks like a few forms.

This version of tk3 supports the USA and other version radios.
Use the Radio pulldown menu and select "Model with 9 kHz
BCB steps" or "Model with 10 kHz BCB steps," depending
on which version radio you have.  The USA and Canadian versions
employ 10 kHz steps in the AM Broadcast Band.

Use of this program with the wrong version radio will result in
unpredictable behavior.

Important: Before trying to reprogram your radio, you should first
read the image from your radio using the
Radio --> Read from radio...
menus and save it in a file using the
File --> Save As...
menus.  You can name is something like "original.tr3".
Back up this file.


You can then export the memory channel information to
a .csv file, using the File --> Export memory channels menu.
Exit tk3.

You can use a text editor or spreadsheet
program to change or pretty-print the data in the .csv file.
Just be sure to write the data out in .csv format again.

You can restart tk3 and read the memory image file
(original.tr3 or whatever you named it) you created earlier,
using the File --> Open menus.

You can then view and change any of the settings.
If you have changed any of the memory channel data
in the .csv file, import it into tk3 using the
File --> Import memory channels menu.

You can check for errors in the data by using the
Data --> Validate menu.

If there are no errors, you should write the infomation
to a new image file (file name ends in .tr3) using the
File --> Save As menu.

You can now program your radio using the
Radio --> Write to radio menu.

Note:  You cannot both read from and write to the radio
during the same tk3 session.




IMPORTING A FREQUENCY LIST FROM A .CSV FILE

Start the program.

Read in an image file (.tr3 extension) using

File -> Open

Import the memory channel information from
your .csv file using:

File -->  Import Memory Channels


Save the updated image in a new .tr3 file using
File --> Save As ...

Write the new image to the radio using

Radio --> Write to radio
